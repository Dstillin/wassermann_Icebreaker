Once upon a time,  I used to drive my BMW from Munich to Raesfeld with my girlfriend every weekend. 
We liked to listen to old german musik while our 7 hours journey. 
My girlfriend had a Hund name rocky who loved klimaanlage on hot summer days. 
Now it all gone, I am no longer able to drive that long in a day. 
I have married my girlfriend in Biergarten in Berlin.
